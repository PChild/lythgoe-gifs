            <p>**some personal news**</p>
            <p>
              For those of you who know me well, I've been a part of The Mech Tech Dragons for the last 10 years.
              It's a competitive amateur robotics team based out of my high school alma mater in Richmond, VA.
            </p>
            <p>
              I mentored full time starting in 2014, after I dropped out of West Virginia University and moved back home to go to school in Richmond.
              I was really bad at this mentoring thing when I started!
              I was very demanding and had a mindset that did not always put the students of the program first.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the years marched forward, I managed to find new and exciting ways to fail at the job, and consequently get better.
              I also progressed through a degree program at VCU.
            </p>
            <p>
              Almost a year ago today, I was in the middle of wrapping up my degree and taking the reins for my first year as head mentor.
              I had an opportunity to work with an incredible group of students who found their passion in achieving the success we craved in the way that mattered to them very personally.
            </p>
            <p>
              After 16 years, the team broke its losing streak and took home an event winner blue banner.
              The team continued to crash through the ceiling of my expectations, winning the region's championship event
              and finishing as divisional finalists at the world postseason expo.
              We also picked up major culture-changing awards along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
              The experience of watching the team I've put so much time in to over the past 10 years humbled me.
              Over the summer, I started to work on my plans for the 2019 season, the team's 20th in operation.
              I wanted to do more--climb higher, reach father, chase greater success.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I ruminated on all of this, I thought about the additional time I would have to commit to see these plans realized, and it was hard to find.
              I want to build a career that's rewarding to me, and I want to run the program to the best of my ability, at the only intensity I know (maximum).
              Ultimately, I can't be someone who does both--at least not not right now.
              I can't short my own opportunities, and I can't bear letting down the team during the commotion season when I fail to meet my obligations.
              The students deserve people who are passionate, tireless leaders, and I can't be that person any more.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is all a really long and sad way of saying that I will be leaving The Mech Tech Dragons before the start of the 2019 season.
              This decision was not made lightly, but after a lot of thinking and discussions with a lot of people, I concluded that this is the right time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'll still be around this fall to ensure the team's success to the best of my ability for the 2019 season.
              I'll be working to make sure I'm made as redundant as possible.
              I will miss these kids with all of my heart, but it's time for me to move forward to something new.
              Even if I am no longer a mentor on the team, I will always be an alumnus and ardent supporter of the Mech Tech Dragons.
            </p>
